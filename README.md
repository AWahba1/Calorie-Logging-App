## Motivation

The Calorie Logging App was developed with a mission to empower users in taking charge of their nutrition and health. By leveraging advanced deep learning models for food item identification and image segmentation, the app provides a seamless and user-friendly experience for tracking calorie intake. Our motivation is to simplify the process of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, making it easier for users to make informed dietary choices and achieve their fitness goals. 

## Features

- **User Authentication**
  - Users can sign up and log in to their accounts to access personalized features.

- **Food Item Identification**
  - Users can capture an image of their food, and the app will automatically identify the food items using deep learning models.

- **Manual Food Search**
  - If the app couldn't identify a food item from the image, users have the option to search for the food manually.

- **Nutritional Information**
  - Users can view detailed nutritional information, including calories and macronutrients, for any food item in the app's database.

- **Food Logging**
  - Users can create, read, update, and delete food logs for any day, allowing them to track their calorie intake easily.


## Technologies Used

The app is built using the following technologies:

- Flutter: A cross-platform UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- Django: A high-level Python web framework for rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- Deep Learning Models:
  - Food Item Classification: A deep learning model trained to recognize food item in a given image.
  - Semantic Segmentation: A deep learning model that accurately segments food items in images.
